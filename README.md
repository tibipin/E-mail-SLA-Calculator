# E-mail-SLA-Calculator

An analytics tool that connects to a generic mailbox, separates e-mail conversations into distinct queries and calculates the response time of each e-mail.
If the e-mail is sent from the generic mailbox, the tool scans the body of an e-mail and detects the team-member that sent the e-mail.
It is possible to add or delete team members based on a database created in sqlite.
The Power BI dashboard gives an overview of how the SLA was achieved and shows the workload distribution across the team.
