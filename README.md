# E-mail-SLA-Calculator

Python script written for Molson Coors GBS which extracts all e-mails from a generic mailbox and performs additional checks through pandas. 
The purpose of the script is to be run directly into Power BI and provide an overview of the extent to which the GBS team is respecting the service level agreements and also generates transparency regarding the workload distribution within the team.
